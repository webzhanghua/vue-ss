# vue-ss

## 安装项目依赖

```
npm install
```

### 公共的壳子配置不同的运行命令

- 执行命令：打包、本地运行 (build/serve)
- 区分多个子项目：项目标识 (project1/project2)
- 运行环境：本地环境、测试环境、线上环境 (local/test/produce)

#### 本地运行

```
npm run serve project1 test
```

#### 打包

```
npm run build project1 test
```

## 说明

此项目是一个壳子项目，公共部分代码放到这个项目里，在 src 目录下创建子项目，同时在 base.config.js 文件中添加该项目的配置信息，子项目专注解决业务代码，调试、打包公共任务，封装在壳子项目中，
